# Cassava-Leaf-Disease-Detection-with-EfficientNet-Keras

Cassava is the second largest provider of carbohydrates in the continent of Africa and is key to growth of small farmers because it can withstand harsh conditions. 
A major percentage of farmers rely on growing this crop but its vulnerability to viral diseases is a major impediment for growth. Image recognition is a fast and inexpensive
means of screening the crops for any present viral disease and can offer means to mitigate the spread of the disease by take effective and immediate remedial actions.
Transfer learning has proven to be one of the most effective methods in various fields of computer vision in recent times. In this kernel we fine tune an EfficientNet based
model to achieve fair results on the Cassava Leaf Disease Classification Dataset.
